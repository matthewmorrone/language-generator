A simple [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation, featuring an 
(theoretical) infinite grid and local game storage.

Planned features:

- Integrating example patterns which are backed by the repository. This would also make it easy for anyone to add new examples to the main page (pull-request to me).
- Importing and exporting of patterns/games.
- Letting the user define his own rules.

If possible, I would like to make this a suitable applications for teaching purposes, if you have any suggestion how to improve this application, please drop me a line.
